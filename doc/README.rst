Documentation
=============

This directory contains documentation for the framework.

Read
----

You can `read the documentation <http://php-framework.readthedocs.org>`_ hosted
at `Read the Docs <http://readthedocs.org/>`_.

Build
-----

This documentation is written using `Sphinx <http://sphinx.pocoo.org/>`_.

On many systems with Python installed, Sphinx can be installed with::

    $ easy_install sphinx

Thus documentation can then be built in HTML format by running ``make html``::

    $ cd doc
    $ make html

The index page will be written to ``doc/build/html/index.html``.
